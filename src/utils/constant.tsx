  "Hi there. My name is Yuanrong, but I go by the name Rex. I graduated from UC Berkeley in 2020 and recently started my master's degree at the University of Toronto to continue learning machine learning. It has been quite a journey for the past few years. Experiencing remote learning was extremely hard. I somehow made it out of school. Now, I am back to school again. My current interests are using machine learning in education.";

const experienceText = [
  "I obtained my bachelor of science degree in Electrical Engineering and Computer Science (EECS) at UC Berkeley. I have used Python, Java, and C in various projects at UC Berkeley. I have studied concepts in computer science, data structures, algorithms, deep learning, artificial intelligence, assembly with RISC-V, and operating systems. Some exciting projects I have done were in the EE department, such as building a voice-controlled vehicle with a PID controller; I had fun creating the microphone board and soldering components onto the board. I have also studied robotics while at UC Berkeley, and I learned ROS during that class. I have also taken some engaging deep learning and machine learning classes at UC Berkeley and the University of Toronto.",
  "I am interested in teaching and education. I was a math tutor at Chaffey College for two years before I went to study at UC Berkeley. It was rewarding to see students improve their skills and understanding of the material. I was also an assistant instructor for a computer science class at UC Berkeley, and answering homework and lab questions from students always helped me consolidate my knowledge.",
  "As a software engineer, I have developed mobile apps on iOS using native Swift and later switched to React Native for all platforms.",
